# Technical Support & Systems Portfolio
This repository contains my technical labs and troubleshooting logs.

## Skills & Tools
* **Environments:** Linux (Debian/Chromebook), Terminal (Bash)
* **Debugging:** GDB (GNU Debugger), Register Analysis
* **Development:** x86 Assembly (NASM), VSCodium

##  Projects
### x86 Assembly Debugging Lab
* **Problem:** Performing arithmetic directly in CPU registers.
* **Solution:** Developed a program to calculate values using EAX, EBX, and ECX registers.
* **Troubleshooting:** Successfully configured GDB 'layout regs' to monitor real-time memory changes when the standard debugger was unresponsive.
  
Technical Skills Summary
Programming & Logic

C++ (1+ Year): Proficient in object-oriented programming, memory management (pointers/references), and troubleshooting complex logic errors.

x86 Assembly: Experienced in low-level hardware interaction, register manipulation (EAX, EBX, etc.), and understanding CPU architecture.

Data Structures: Familiar with arrays, linked lists, and algorithmic efficiency.

Systems & Troubleshooting

Linux Environment: Daily use of Debian-based systems via Chromebook Linux container (Crostini).

Command Line Mastery: Comfortable with Bash, file system navigation, and terminal-based tools.

Professional Debugging: Advanced use of GDB (GNU Debugger) to perform real-time register analysis and stack tracing.

Tools & Workflow

Version Control: Git/GitHub for project documentation and code management.

IDE/Editors: VSCodium (Open-source VS Code), NASM, and GCC compilers.
